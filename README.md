# PharoRoulette (Work in progress !)

This project has started during the ESUG 2017. Inspired by the many speakers I wanted to learn more about web development using Seaside and in particular using callbacks. Putting this into practice I came up with the idea to build a roulette game. Rien ne va plus !
